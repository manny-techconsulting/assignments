    "Reading and writing data from and to files is a fundamental element of data processing.\n",
    "Therefore it is important we understand how python accesses files and formats that data for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main method of accessing a file is by using the `open()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` method returns a file object and accepts two positional arguments--the name of the file and the access mode--and one keyword argument describing the encoding of the file: `open('name of file', 'mode','encoding=')`\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practice:\n",
    "Always use the keyword `with` when dealing with file objects because even if the object raises an exception, we can properly close the file object. If the `with` keyword is not used, call the `close()` method to free up system resources used by it."
